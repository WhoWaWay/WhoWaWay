## Selection Process
The initial process after generating concepts, was determined by the feasibility of completing the prototype by the deadline, our teamâ€™s existing knowledge, and the best parts of other concepts. Our final concept has changed multiple times over the past few weeks, from an Umbrella Hat to a Smart Plant Pot, and finally to an R/C car that will collect data. Each of the concepts was iterated upon as the prototype changed, ultimately the R/C car that was brought up in passing during the design ideation process became our focus and incorporated all our requirements adequately. 

The small size of the R/C makes it lightweight and easy to carry for all potential users, the protective case on the exterior ensures it will withstand most regular weather conditions. The parts that we have selected ensure that if damaged in a way that will hinder functionality, they can be cheaply replaced relatively quickly. As the design is mostly utilitarian, there is little possibility of the R/C getting caught on twigs or rocks in urban areas.
