First, we divided and chose the subsystems that we wanted to work on. Then we found the components that we needed to fulfill the requirements, we added two sensors, a temperature sensor and a humidity sensor, two motors, debug LEDs, push buttons, and the microcontroller that we would work with. We also have a power regulator since not all the components use the same voltage, the DC motor would connect to the 9V battery, the stepper motor would connect to the 6.6V power, and others would connect to the 3.3V switching regulator. We have also found which pins connect from the microcontroller to the components. We also want the MQTT server to store the data received from the microcontroller.
