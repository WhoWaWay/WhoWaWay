# List of Recommendations
## 1
The class is difficult so you should take care to get things completed on time or be prepared to complete things late.
Engineering doesn't always adhere to your proposed schedule so don't worry about things getting a little behind.

## 2
Meetings should be held regularly (at least once or twice a week even if only online) at times when your team is all available preferably.
If your teammates don't make an effort to attend or don't help much with keeping on deadlines, drop them. You are better off without deadweight whether or not it makes you feel bad.

## 3
All engineering software UI sucks, it doesn't get easier, just more bearable. If you have a good idea of what you want to make, sketch it out first and then put it onto the computer.
Use tutorial videos on the software before you have a deadline looming over you to mitigate stress.

## 4
Procrastination and Depression are common things you may experience, they are side effects of not working with good teammates and feeling as if you are falling behind.
Therapy may or may not help (as it hasn't for me) but learning study habits and keeping work and home separate are important to deal with this. Potentially do homework primarily at school or in a public place like a coffee shop.

## 5
You can have fun in this course, remember that eventually it must be professional and it doesn't have to start that way. Take advice from any professionals you can and keep in mind that your effort directly translates to how willing people will be to give you funding.
