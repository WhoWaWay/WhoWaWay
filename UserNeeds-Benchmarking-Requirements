# User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirement
* After reading several product reviews, the team came up with the user needs list. We learned what the user needs in a product. Users need a product that works, easy to use with simple instructions, and does what it is meant for. Then, we sorted the user needs into five categories: pricing, features, user-friendliness, design, and safety. Users need a product that has the features they are looking for, safe to use, stable connection, and at a reasonable price.
