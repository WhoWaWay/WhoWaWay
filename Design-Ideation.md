## What role did each team member play in generating ideas?
* Each team member plays a role in generating ideas since the beginning of the class. Ideas can be any sort of design. Nevertheless, it needs to fulfill the requirement, or the limitation, given by the course. Each member first gave their own thought in the team on what sensors the team should use. After the first discussion, the team came up with an idea to make an umbrella hat where the weather station on the umbrella would make the decision to open up itself based on the weather. Nevertheless, when the team tried to design it, we noticed that there were a lot of flaws in the design. Each member provided possible ideas the team could make and after carefully considering the team selected the Solar Bloom Pot, Smart Bike, and Weather Station Smart House as our 3 main concepts.

## What types of brainstorming worked? What didnâ€™t?
* First, we started drawing ideas that thought would match the requirements of the project, which was very helpful in visualizing what we needed and wanted to do. Then, we started a jamboard, and we all put ideas that matched what we needed for the project. This was the only method we used and think that it worked pretty well because piling up ideas without thinking if it worked or not, or being embarrassed, allowed us to generate ideas that are useful and worth trying. Lastly, we grouped similar ideas together, put them into a few categories, and ranked them into three levels.

## What was your process for organizing and ranking ideas? Who created or sketched each concept?
* All team members participated in generating ideas for the three design concepts. For the final designs and details for the 3 designs, Lana designed the Solar Bloom Pot, Maryam provided the GPS bicycle idea, and Ethan created the Smart House concept. LuYan created and sketched the diagrams for the Solar Bloom Pot and GPS bicycle, and Ethan sketched the concepts for the Smart House.

# Design Concepts
## Concept 1: Solar Bloom Pot

* Our first concept is a flower pot that blends sustainable technology with optimal plant care. Powered by solar panels, this eco-friendly pot features temperature and humidity sensors to determine the ideal watering schedule for plants. The built-in display showcases real-time temperature, current time, and watering history, providing plant enthusiasts with a comprehensive monitoring system as well as a portable weather station. By harnessing solar energy, the Solar Bloom Pot ensures the longevity of its smart features while promoting efficient and environmentally conscious plant care.

## Concept 2: Smart bike

* Our second concept is a bike with a temperature sensor and humidity sensor. The solar panels would be on the net behind the seat, and the sensors needed would be right above the front wheel of the bike. These sensors would connect to an LCD screen to display real-time readings of the weather, which would be attached to the handle of the bike. The LCD screen would also be used for GPS, and depending on the weather alerts, it would reroute.

## Concept 3: Weather Station Smart House

* The Smart House concept can change the conditions based on the external sensors for a better home experience as a homeowner. From within the home, a weather and climate control panel is located by the patio that displays the current weather outside with various measurements along with the temperature and humidity inside the home. Using the data received from the solar panel, the smart home can also lower the patio from its stowed position for lounging in good weather. Finally, if extreme weather conditions are detected from external sources or sensors, the smart home will sound an alarm and begin a lockdown scenario (closing the patio and sealing blinds) if no further inputs from the homeowner are received.
