The schematic shows the components the team will use in the prototype. The main components include:
* A 16-bit microcontroller 
* An OLED screen for showing sensor data
* An ESP32 for WiFi connection
* A stepper motor for wheel steering
* 5 sensors (Humidity Sensor, Temperature Sensor, UV Light Sensor, Hall Effect Sensor)
* A switching regulator to provide 3.3V for the microcontroller and sensors 
* A 6.6V power regulator for the stepper motor

The humidity and temperature sensors are the teamâ€™s main subsystems for this project. We have three extra sensors for the prototype which will be kept in the final design if they work because we think that a weather station should be able to output more weather information than just temperature and humidity data.
