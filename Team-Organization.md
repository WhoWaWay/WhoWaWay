## Charter:
* Our team's goal is to create a portable weather station to inform the user of the current UV light, humidity, and wind speed. This device should be able to water the plants/flowers by sensing the temperature and humidity, connecting to wifi as well as alerting the user of severe weather changes. 
## Mission Statement:
* The primary objective is to create a user-friendly smart flower pot capable of autonomously expanding its protection based on real-time environmental conditions. Additionally, the system will incorporate a feature to record wind force, enhancing the flower’s safety and convenience for the plant’s owner. This design will seamlessly integrate temperature and humidity sensors, providing an innovative solution for ultimate greenhouse protection.


## Roles and Responsibilities

Interactive lessons and research/switch assigned sections based on ability.
