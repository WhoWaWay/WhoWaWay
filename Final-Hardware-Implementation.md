# Hardware Proposal

The schematic shows the components the team will use in the prototype. The main components include:
* A 8-bit microcontroller 
* An OLED screen for showing sensor data
* An ESP32 for WiFi connection
* A stepper motor for wheel steering
* 4 sensors (Humidity Sensor, Temperature Sensor, Hall Effect Sensor, UV Light Sensor(Extra))
* A switching regulator to provide 3.3V for the microcontroller and sensors 
* A 7.4V power regulator for the stepper motor

The humidity and temperature sensors are the teamâ€™s main subsystems for this project. We have two extra sensors for the prototype which is kept in the final design because we think that a weather station should be able to output more weather information than just temperature and humidity data.

In our final design, we managed to get everything to work as expected. Although the UV light sensor is not used in the showcase due to a limited time frame, components including the humidity, temperature, and hall effect sensors, and the motor components all work together as expected.
