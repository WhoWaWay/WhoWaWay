# User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirement
* After reading several product reviews, the team came up with the user needs list. We learned what the user needs in a product. Users need a product that works, easy to use with simple instructions, and does what it is meant for. Then, we sorted the user needs into five categories: pricing, features, user-friendliness, design, and safety. Users need a product that has the features they are looking for, safe to use, stable connection, and at a reasonable price.

## What role did each team member play in generating ideas?
* Each team member plays a role in generating ideas since the beginning of the class. Ideas can be any sort of design. Nevertheless, it needs to fulfill the requirement, or the limitation, given by the course. Each member first gave their own thought in the team on what sensors the team should use. After the first discussion, the team came up with an idea to make an umbrella hat where the weather station on the umbrella would make the decision to open up itself based on the weather. Nevertheless, when the team tried to design it, we noticed that there were a lot of flaws in the design. Each member provided possible ideas the team could make and after carefully considering the team selected the Solar Bloom Pot, Smart Bike, and Weather Station Smart House as our 3 main concepts.

## What types of brainstorming worked? What didnâ€™t?
* First, we started drawing ideas that thought would match the requirements of the project, which was very helpful in visualizing what we needed and wanted to do. Then, we started a jamboard, and we all put ideas that matched what we needed for the project. This was the only method we used and think that it worked pretty well because piling up ideas without thinking if it worked or not, or being embarrassed, allowed us to generate ideas that are useful and worth trying. Lastly, we grouped similar ideas together, put them into a few categories, and ranked them into three levels.

## What was your process for organizing and ranking ideas? Who created or sketched each concept?
* All team members participated in generating ideas for the three design concepts. For the final designs and details for the 3 designs, Lana designed the Solar Bloom Pot, Maryam provided the GPS bicycle idea, and Ethan created the Smart House concept. LuYan created and sketched the diagrams for the Solar Bloom Pot and GPS bicycle, and Ethan sketched the concepts for the Smart House.
