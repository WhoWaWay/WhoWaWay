## Charter:
* Our team's goal is to create a portable weather station to inform the user of the current humidity, temperature, and other weather data. This device will be able to travel across the ground to create a localized weather map using temperature and humidity, connecting to wifi as well as alerting the user of severe weather changes. 
## Mission Statement:
* The primary objective is to create a user-friendly R/C car that can autonomously compile real-time environmental conditions. Additionally, the system will incorporate a feature for manual control. This design will seamlessly integrate temperature and humidity sensors, providing an innovative solution for the ultimate mix between work and play.
