# User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirement
* After reading several product reviews, the team came up with the user needs list. We learned what the user needs in a product. Users need a product that works, easy to use with simple instructions, and does what it is meant for. Then, we sorted the user needs into five categories: pricing, features, user-friendliness, design, and safety. Users need a product that has the features they are looking for, safe to use, stable connection, and at a reasonable price. 

# Helicopter Umbrella Hat
Date of Creation: 1/17/2024

Version 1.0

## Introduction
Who-wa-way was among the first truly beat pad sleeves and generated excessive demand with sales units in just the first year after launch. These will be backed by technological developments such as the microcontroller chip, Cypress CY8C4146FN PSoC, dual beam-forming microphones, Bluetooth 5.2, iOS Bluebonnet, force-sensitive resistors, gyroscopes, and IR proximity sensors.

## Objectives
With Project Hestia, the goal is to create something that prevents moisture and detects temperature during outdoor activities. It is designed for those with weak limbs who want something to stand out from the common masses.

## Use Cases
* User Story #1: Ethan Conner (AI)
  
Once upon a time, there was a man named Ethan Conner who loved gardens but had a hard time remembering to water them. One day, he decided to invest in a smart flower pot that would help him take care of his plants. The pot was equipped with sensors that could detect the moisture level of the soil, the amount of sunlight the plant was receiving, and the temperature of the environment.
Ethan was thrilled with his new purchase and immediately planted a Chrysanthemum in the pot. He was amazed at how quickly the plant began to grow and how green it looked in person. The smart flower pot would send him notifications on his phone when the plant needed water or when it was getting too much sunlight.
Ethan was so impressed with the smart flower pot that he decided to buy more and expand his new garden. He spent hours every day tending to his plants and watching them grow. He even started to experiment with different types of plants and flowers to see which ones would thrive in the smart flower pots.
One day, Ethan’s neighbor came over to admire his garden. She was so impressed with the smart flower pots that she decided to buy one for herself. Ethan was happy to know that his neighbors also had a hard time making time for plants and excitedly explained the setup process.
From that day on, Ethan’s garden became the focal point of his village. People would come from all over to see his beautiful plants and flowers. Ethan was proud of what he had accomplished and was grateful for the smart flower pot that had helped him achieve his dream of opening a garden.

* User Story #2: Sarah (AI)
  
Sarah loved gardening but she didn’t have a green thumb. She invested in a smart flower pot that could detect the moisture level of the soil, the amount of sunlight the plant was receiving, and the temperature of the environment. The pot would send her notifications on her phone when the plant needed water or when it was getting too much sunlight. Sarah was thrilled with her new purchase and planned to defend her home from the zombie horde.
