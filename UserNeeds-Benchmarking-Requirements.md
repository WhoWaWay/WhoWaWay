# User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirement
* After reading several product reviews, the team came up with the user needs list. We learned what the user needs in a product. Users need a product that works, easy to use with simple instructions, and does what it is meant for. Then, we sorted the user needs into five categories: pricing, features, user-friendliness, design, and safety. Users need a product that has the features they are looking for, safe to use, stable connection, and at a reasonable price. 

# Weather R/C Robot
Date of Creation: 1/17/2024

Version 1.2

## Introduction
Who-wa-way was among the first truly beat pad sleeves and generated excessive demand with sales units in just the first year after launch. These will be backed by technological developments such as the microcontroller chip, Cypress CY8C4146FN PSoC, dual beam-forming microphones, Bluetooth 5.2, iOS Bluebonnet, force-sensitive resistors, gyroscopes, and IR proximity sensors.

## Objectives
With Project Hestia, the goal is to create something that can measure moisture and detect temperature during outdoor activities. It is designed for those interested in accurately recording the weatherscape in various environments while having the option to use it for recreation.

## Stakeholders & Target group: 
R/C enthusiasts, and Environmental Researchers

## Use Cases
* User Story #1: Ethan Conner (AI)
  
Ethan Conner, an avid gardener, faced challenges in monitoring weather conditions vital for plant care. Seeking a solution, Ethan invested in a weather-tracking R/C car equipped with advanced sensors. These sensors accurately detected air moisture, sunlight levels, and environmental temperature, aiding Ethan in optimizing plant care. Impressed by the R/C car’s performance, Ethan planted a Chrysanthemum in his garden and marveled at its rapid growth and lush appearance. The R/C car seamlessly communicated plant care needs via phone notifications, alerting Ethan to water adjustments and sunlight exposure. Encouraged by the success, Ethan expanded his garden using multiple weather-tracking R/C cars. He diligently tended to his plants, experimenting with various species to optimize growth under the R/C cars’ monitoring. Ethan’s garden soon became a community attraction, drawing admiration from neighbors and visitors alike. His success inspired others to adopt weather-tracking R/C cars for efficient plant care.

* User Story #2: Sarah (AI)
  
As a passionate storm enthusiast and data enthusiast, Sara seeks a reliable and cost-effective solution for gathering real-time weather information within storms. She has invested in a Weather Tracking R/C car equipped with advanced sensors to measure various weather parameters. This R/C car delivers instant notifications to her mobile device, updating regularly with precise data. With this innovative tool, Sara can safely collect storm data without endangering herself or others. Moreover, she aims to leverage this data to enhance her storm prediction capabilities, supplementing or even surpassing traditional weather forecasts, which she finds less reliable. Sara is excited to test this R/C car in the upcoming tornado season and use its insights to make informed decisions regarding storm tracking and safety measures.
